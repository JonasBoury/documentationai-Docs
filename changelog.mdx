## Release History

<Update label="2024-10-15" description="v2.1.0" tags={["feature", "improvement"]}>

## New Features

- Added support for DAI stablecoin in payment processing. You now accept DAI alongside USDC for seamless stablecoin transactions.
- Introduced volume-based fee tiers for high-traffic merchants. Eligible users see reduced rates starting at 0.3% for over 1,000 monthly transactions.

## Improvements

- Enhanced webhook delivery with retry logic up to 5 attempts. This reduces missed notifications during temporary outages.
- Optimized API response times by 20% through caching mechanisms. Retrieval calls now average under 100ms.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed intermittent 500 errors on large metadata payloads. You can now include up to 10KB without issues.

- Launched Web3 token support including ETH and BTC. Integrate crypto payments with the same API endpoints as fiat.
- Added dashboard analytics for transaction trends. View charts for volume, fees, and settlement times directly.

## Breaking Changes

- Changed default pagination limit from 50 to 20 for list endpoints. Adjust `limit` parameter to maintain previous behavior.

## Improvements
