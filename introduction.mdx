## Use Cases

Businesses use Citizen Pay for e-commerce, freelancing platforms, and DeFi applications. For example, an online store accepts ETH alongside credit cards seamlessly. The API returns real-time status updates for all transactions.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
const result = await client.payments.retrieve('pay_123');
if (result.status === 'settled') {
  // Fulfill order
}
```
  ```python
import citizenpay

client = citizenpay.Client(api_key='your-api-key')
result = client.payments.retrieve('pay_123')
if result.status == 'settled':
    # Fulfill order
```
</CodeGroup>

You monitor transactions via webhooks for events like settlements. This ensures you stay updated without polling. Citizen Pay's documentation covers advanced topics like error handling and compliance.

## Best Practices

Always validate inputs before sending requests. Use environment variables for API keys to enhance security. Test thoroughly in sandbox mode to avoid production issues.
