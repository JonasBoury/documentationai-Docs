description: Protocol for transferring orders and managing order-based transactions
---

## Overview

The Order Transfer Protocol enables seamless transfer of orders between parties and integration with payment systems. This protocol works in conjunction with the ERC20 Treasury Sync to provide a complete order and payment management solution.

## Key Concepts

The Order Transfer Protocol handles the lifecycle of orders from creation through completion, ensuring that payments and transfers are properly synchronized with treasury operations.

## Integration with Treasury Sync

Orders can be completed through operations in the ERC20 Treasury Sync system. When an operation is processed with an attached order ID, it automatically completes the corresponding order.

## Order States

Orders progress through various states during their lifecycle:

* `pending` - Order has been created and is awaiting processing
* `processing` - Order is being processed
* `completed` - Order has been successfully completed
* `failed` - Order processing failed
* `cancelled` - Order was cancelled

## Use Cases

The Order Transfer Protocol supports various use cases including:

* E-commerce order fulfillment
* Subscription management
* Marketplace transactions
* Cross-platform order transfers
